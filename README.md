# Bulldozer Prices ML Project

This is a little project I started during an online course. It's based around a now <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers">finished competition</a> on Kaggle. The main task was propper feature engineering and then predicting prices of sold bulldozers. That means - this is a regression problem, that in this notebook I face with the help of scikit-learn estimator chart and `RandomForestRegressor()`.

The history behind this notebook is funny however! I'm going to be honest and a bit blunt - I didn't really care for this notebook. I didn't care so much in fact that after I created the repository I sat down, quickly finished the notebook and then... Nothing! I moved onto neural networks, which was far more interesting in my opinion. I created <a href="https://aleksanderc.pythonanywhere.com/identibreed.html">IdentiBreed</a>, worked on that a lot and then moved back to the <a href="https://github.com/Ale-Cie/heart_disease_project">Heart Disease ML Project</a>. After working on this one for about three months I sat down to updating my portfolio website. When I started making hyperlink cards to my Jupyter Notebook projects was when I found out that this repository was empty, since the moment I made it.

And that's where we are now! Five months and 10 days since the creation of the repository I'm updating it for the first and the last time. I'll sum up the commit timeline quickly here:

<i>-- 17.09.2023 --</i>

Repository was unearthed while making a webpage. `README.md` was written quickly, `.gitignore` was established and then all files were pushed into the repository.

<i>-- ??? ---</i>

The only notebook present in this repostiory was completed.

<i>-- 7.04.2023 --</i>

The repository was created.
